								You've saved me time and money. 
								I've recently been purchasing gifts for all of my bridesmaids for my upcoming wedding, 
								all on ebay, all using esnipe. 
								At this time in my life, which is so busy, 
								esnipe has taken off some of the pressure, 
								not to mention helped me to get GREAT deals on beautiful jewelry. 
								You've even helped me to purchase the jewelry I'm going to wear at the wedding. 
								So this is just a THANK YOU for this wonderful service. 
								Also, I'm an artist, and I purchase things on ebay to use in my sculptures. 
								Your service means that I can arrange to bid on something in the middle of the night 
								when inspiration strikes and know that I can forget about it and 
								esnipe will take care of it for me. I can't tell you how much I appreciate THAT!
